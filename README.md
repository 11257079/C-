C++ Programming Basics

Overview

This repository contains basic C++ programs designed for beginners who are learning the fundamentals of C++ programming. The programs included cover essential concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and basic input/output operations.

Contents

The repository includes the following C++ programs:

hello_world.cpp - A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

age.cpp - A program that takes user input for age and provides an appropriate message.

conditional_statement.cpp - Demonstrates if-else conditional statements in C++.

factorial.cpp - A program that calculates the factorial of a number using loops.

if_clause.cpp - Another example demonstrating conditional statements.
