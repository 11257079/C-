# C++ Basics Repository

## Overview
This repository contains fundamental C++ programs that cover essential concepts such as:
- Input/Output operations
- Arithmetic operations
- Loops (while, for)
- Recursive functions
- Conditional statements

## Files Included
- `hello_world.cpp`: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" and performs basic arithmetic operations.
- `factorial.cpp`: Implements a recursive function to compute the factorial of a given number.
- `conditional_statement.cpp`: Demonstrates the use of conditional statements to evaluate different conditions.
- `if_clause.cpp`: Showcases an example of decision-making using if-else conditions.
- `age.cpp`: A program that takes user input for age and determines whether the age is valid based on a given condition.
- `calculator.cpp`: A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two integer inputs.
- `sum_loops.cpp`: Illustrates the use of loops by calculating the sum of a range of numbers using both while and for loops.
- `money_check.cpp`: A program that checks a user's available money and makes a decision based on a specified amount

## Topics Covered
- **Basic Input and Output (cin, cout)**
- **Control Flow (if-else, loops)**
- **Functions and Recursion**
- **Mathematical Operations**
- **Basic Algorithms**

## Why Learn C++?
C++ is a powerful and widely used programming language, ideal for beginners who want to build a strong foundation in programming. The programs in this repository provide practical examples to help learners understand core programming concepts.
